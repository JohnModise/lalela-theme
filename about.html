  			<p>Based in Eupen / Belgium and as an artistic and / or socio – political – science platform and investigator,
          Lalela is influenced but not limited by current, historical and fast changing global social politics.
          We mirror our society of diverse ages and create performing art productions as entertainment and possibility to bring about a dialogue amongst ourselves as a people.
          We research and study stories, then present them in front of an audience in all possible or chosen performing   art form/s.
          Since stories were there long before the existence of humans, we then have an opportunity to use this simple philosophy to design productions for audiences from very young to old ages.
          We make it our duty to tell stories that talk of and connect with our modern society. We want to invest on and further develop a progressive generation of artists and audiences.
          With Xolani Mdluli as artistic director and actor, Lalela creates and coproduces a variety of stage entertainment from theatre productions, dance theatre productions, stand – up comedy etc,
          for audiences of very tender ages up until senior citizens. Through our broad and unique cooperation partnership data, we are able to reach out for audiences beyond Eupen and the Belgian borders.
          We live at a time that is much influenced and accelerated by multimedia and digitalized modern technology. In order to effectively reach out to a broader audience,
          we work with artists from different backgrounds and cultures. With their special skills and experiences, we make use of theatre, dance,
          abstract and grotesque text, multimedia and digital possibilities in order to enter into a dialogue with the audiences.
